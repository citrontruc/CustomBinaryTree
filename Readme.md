# Custom Binary Tree

A project to implement a binary search tree and implement tree search methods.

The project has four different types of trees:

- Binary Trees (No constraints on nodes, they can have up to two child nodes).
- Binary Search Trees (Nodes have an order relationship).
- Balanced Binary trees (Nodes don't have any value based relationships but depth difference right and left branches must be at most 1).
- Balanced Binary trees (all the previous constaints).

All operations (adding nodes, removing nodes) must protect the relationship.
